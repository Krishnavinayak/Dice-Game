# 🎲 Dicee - Flutter Dice Game App

This is a simple Flutter application that simulates rolling two dice. When you tap on either die, both dice will roll and generate new random numbers from 1 to 6.

## 🛠️ Built With

- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) (Dart)
- Stateless and Stateful Widgets
- Basic UI using `Image`, `Row`, and `TextButton`
- Random number generation in Dart

## 📱 Features

- Two dice displayed side by side
- Tap on either dice to roll both
- Dice images update instantly based on random values

## 🔁 How It Works

- Dice images are stored as assets in the `images/` folder.
- On tap, a new random number (1–6) is generated for each dice using Dart's `Random` class.
- Corresponding dice images are displayed dynamically.
